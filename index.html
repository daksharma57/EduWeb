            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.Formal education is commonly
                divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.A right to education has been
                recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] In most regions,
                education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform, and in particular
                for evidence-based education with global initiatives aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal
                4, which promotes quality education for all</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public
                education. Children with disabilities were repeatedly denied an education by physicians or special
                tutors. These early physicians (people like Itard, Seguin, Howe, Gallaudet) set the foundation for
                special education today. They focused on individualized instruction and functional skills. In its early
                years, special education was only provided to people with severe disabilities, but more recently it has
                been opened to anyone who has experienced difficulty learning.Similarities – in systems or even in ideas
                – that schools share internationally have led to an increase in international student exchanges. The
                European Socrates-Erasmus Programme[50] facilitates exchanges across European universities.Technology
                plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in
                impoverished areas.</p>

                capable of instilling social change and economic advancement in developing countries by giving
                communities the opportunity to take control of their destinies.The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
                Development, adopted by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in September 2015, calls for a new
                vision to address the environmental, social and economic concerns facing the world today. The Agenda
                includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG 4 on education.Since 1909, the
                percentage of children in the developing world attending school has increased. Before
                then, a small minority of boys attended school. By the start of the twenty-first century, the majority
                of children in most regions of the world attended school.[citation needed]Universal Primary Education
                was one of the eight international Millennium Development Goals, towardswhich progress has been made in
                the past decade, though barriers still remain.[47] Securing charitable
                funding from prospective donors is one particularly persistent problem. </p>
